# Charging-Station-Scheduling-for-Electric-Vehicles
The goal of this project is to develop a basic simulation of Electric Vehicle charging that allows the use of different heuristic strategies for comparison.

Real-World use: Can be used in optimising charging schedules for public transit vehicles (e.g. battery-powered buses)
Possible heuristic strategies: First-in-First-out; Lowest-Charge-Highest-Priority; Highest-Charge-Highest-Priority; 
Inputs: Locations of Charging Points; Timetable of current Bus routes; Bus properties (consumption/h in kW/h, battery capacity)
